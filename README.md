        <p>I am a 21-year-old computer science student specializing in web development, though I have a deep passion for all CS-related topics. Over the years, I have worked on several         commercial projects, gaining valuable experience in the process. Outside of the web, I have experience in app development, as well as robotics, JAVA, Rust, computer graphics,           3D modelling with Blender and server setup, network engineering. </p>
