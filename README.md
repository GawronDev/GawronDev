### Hi I'm Jakub 👋
---
I'm a 20 year old computer science student. I specialise in frontend development and design but I have a lot of passion for all CS related topics. I also run a YouTube channel under a nickname “Codeolences” where I make videos about topics more or less connected with technology and programming.
